# How can I run this application? 

In order to run this application, a modern version of Python must be installed on the host machine. It is recommended 
that a virtual environment be created for this application. To create this environment, run the command "python -m venv 
env" on the command line or terminal. To use this newly created virtual environment, on Windows run the command
"env/Scripts/activate.bat" on the command line, and on Linux run the command "source env/bin/activate".

After the environment has been activate, the required packages may be installed with the command, pip install -r 
requirements.txt. After this is done, the application may be run with the command python main.py on the command line.
